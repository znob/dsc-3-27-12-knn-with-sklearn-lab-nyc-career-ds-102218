    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use KNN to make classification predictions on a real-world dataset\n",
    "* Perform a parameter search for 'k' to optimize model performance\n",
    "* Evaluate model performance and interpret results\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll make use of sklearn's implementation of the **_K-Nearest Neighbors_** algorithm. We'll use it to make predictions on the Titanic dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing the dataset, and then deal with preprocessing steps such as removing unnecessary columns and normalizing our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find the titanic dataset stored in the `titanic.csv` file. In the cell below:\n",

The final step we we'll take in our preprocessing efforts is to **_Normalize_** our data. Recall that normalization (also sometimes called **_Standardization_** or **_Scaling_**) means making sure that all of our data is represented at the same scale.  The most common way to do this is to convert all numerical values to z-scores. \n",
